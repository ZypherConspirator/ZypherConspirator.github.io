for an course assignment, this website was mandate to be made.

good thing im good with tech as i do i have a minor intrest and a diploma in studying stuff like this.

ive started with a mindset of:
- finding a website that can host of free
- something to base of the website from to make it easy to work with

ive used HUGO and Github for this website (if it werent obivious). had to relearn again on how to work with HTML, Javascript and the Css magic. quite hard as im didnt learn this from a Major course provided a guideline to making stuff like this. so self-taught perseverance all the way.

ive learned that designing a website requires alot of retrospective view on how you interact with websites. since it is made for others to see, i had to design it where its quite easy to navigate and know where you are at any given moment. easy way to see it is just to view it all like a blog, you got homepage, list page and the post. its all about arranging it to Not look like a blog.
