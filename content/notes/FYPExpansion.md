as i go thru making this large Project with all its documetaion conundrum, i thought why not make this expandable as a personal animated series? since precipes (now named Eidologue) was based on the idea of Personal Introspection and Growth why not cover on other topics

like a struggle of writing story of the self, Simple Greed or the moment precipes of death.

i think of naming the series, Prismatic, to showcase the various perspectives I kept looking into. Eidologue would be retroactively the first and the "White" of the spectrum of the series.
