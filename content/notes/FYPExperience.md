title: "The Final Year Plan"
Date: 2024-10-07

going to into Animation i sort of expect that i would be doing a large scale animation. so ive planned since entry, what story to do what kind of style im going for etc.

early in my studies i was more hesitant on making my own project but things change. ive planned to teamed up with my classmate, Firdaus (NoahSingka), to be his right hand man. this is cause he was so adamant in doing a story of a sarawakian Myth, Bujang Senang. he has large connections with the people in the malaysian Animation Industry thus theorized that making a Malaysian Myth in animation with the fuild style of animation like in Anime would make a big splash. 

ive already drafted 3 stories and tested out sculpt for design for Bujang for him to use a references in animation later.

but by the tail end before final Year began, i saw that i didnt do much to help with his 2D focused pipeline thus i diverge and made my own project. althought this wasnt a difficult process as im known for my production process of brainstorming ideas non-stop but it was going to be trouble during the research end of it. since i could compete with Firdaus's 2D Anime Sakuga or the other's classmate's more refined skillset, i thought "why not experiment".

this lead to the creation of "Precipes". it was an experimental short based on the idea of making a whole animated short on Still Shots. i was going for more of a self-discovery route, more philosophy driven story thus work well with limiation like minimalism.
