### The Incoming Presence
going to into Animation i sort of expect that i would be doing a large scale animation. so ive planned since entry, what story to do what kind of style im going for etc.

early in my studies i was more hesitant on making my own project but things change. ive planned to teamed up with my classmate, Firdaus (NoahSingka), to be his right hand man. this is cause he was so adamant in doing a story of a sarawakian Myth, Bujang Senang. he has large connections with the people in the malaysian Animation Industry thus theorized that making a Malaysian Myth in animation with the fuild style of animation like in Anime would make a big splash. 

ive already drafted 3 stories and tested out sculpt for design for Bujang for him to use a references in animation later.

### The Tail End
but near the end before final Year began, i saw that i didnt do much to help with his 2D focused pipeline thus i diverge and made my own project. although this was'nt a difficult of process as im confident with production process of brainstorming ideas non-stop but it was going to be trouble during the research end of it. 

since this was my own project i want it to stand out from my Predecessor and peers. i see it you could do "refinement", the idea of making something contemporary but really2 honed in on the style and presentation, Or one could go "Experiment", the idea of making something fully new and different.

so i went with experimental route.

this lead to the creation of "Precipes". it was an experimental short based on the idea of making a whole animated short on Still Shots. i was going for more of a self-discovery route, more philosophy driven story thus work well with limiation like minimalism.
