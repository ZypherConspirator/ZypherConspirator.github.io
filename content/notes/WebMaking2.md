#### Oh Boy Here We Go Again
well after years of reflecting on the website ive made for myself, ive finally decided to bite the bullet and do a complete makeover.

got too many comments of the website looking dull even though it was impressive on a technical level. now il focus on visual fedelity instead.
with that said, its not like its not going to be highly technical, might be more so.

#### Here's What i Got Cookin'
so the design framework i got here is basically, a website that made scrolling less nesssary, everything in plain view. i want the main page to be a "Hero Page" where i want to mainline that i am a 3D artist so to speak.
