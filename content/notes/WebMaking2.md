#### Oh Boy Here We Go Again
well after 2 years of reflecting on the website ive made for myself, ive finally decided to bite the bullet and do a complete makeover.

got too many comments of the website looking dull even though it was impressive on a technical level. now il focus on visual fedelity instead.
with that said, its not like its not going to be highly technical, might be more so.

#### Here's What i Got Cookin'
so the design framework i worked up:
- a website that made scrolling less nesssary, everything in plain view. 
- focus on more variations of the same thing.
- make it as flexible as possible.

this basically mean that 

### Cool Nifty stuff

if you would notice ive laced all the pictures on here with a certain noise code i cooked up. its add noise and my watermark on every marked < canvas >. This was a carryover from v1 of the site. this was made less about Anti-AI more toward Anti-Copy Pasting my work, not sure how actually effective is it but its more for my peace of mind.
