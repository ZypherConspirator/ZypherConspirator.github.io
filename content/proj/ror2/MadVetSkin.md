## whats this?

this series of character skins is made by me attempting to put a personal spin on the modding community. 

during the early conception of the modding community, skins were just essentially a testing ground for new upcoming modders to test the waters, as before they were just simple colour swaps of the playable characters

this was one of the first to put an actual concept behind the skins that sparked the community to experiment.

## Concept
the idea behind this one is to joke around about the inside jokes of the stategies employed for playing each characters and using that as a base to build a design out of.

example;
Engineer - Stategy known for its "AFK" capabiities and its over use of Bustling Fungus, an item that heals if arent moving. - Infested by B.Fungus

### How its made?

its made by utilizing a skinbuilder made by @kingenderbrine & @runefox on the Risk of Rain 2 Modding Discord. 

i did do some bit of modification to the code but nothing substantial.
