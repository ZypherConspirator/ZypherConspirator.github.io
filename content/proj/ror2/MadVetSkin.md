## whats this?

this series of character skins made by me attempting to put a personal spin on the modding community. 
during the early conception of the modding community, skins were just essentially a testing ground for new upcoming modders to test the waters, as before they were just simple colour swaps of the playable characters or a highly personalized skin that is meant for personal use only.

this was one of the first to put an actual concept behind the skins that sparked the community to experiment with more intresting ideas.

## Concept
the idea behind this one is to joke around about the inside jokes of the stategies employed for playing each characters and using that as a base to build a design out of.

for example;
The Engineer has ability loadout that encourages the place to just play in a more passive manner, letting his portable turrets do the heavy lifting. Risk of rain 2 is mainly gameplay is running away and trying to survive. There is this Item, Bustling Fungus, that heals if stood still. Since Risk of Rain 2's gameplay encourages stacking multiple items to increase its power, Engineer was one of the few that can leverage it's application to the point of being able to survive the end of the game without touching the keyboard. it required an absurd amount B.Fungus but still possible.

the Community start calling it the Bungus Strat. i Took that visual and made it into reality.

here are the rest of the ideas for the character;

{{< bootstrap-table table_class="table table-dark table-striped table-bordered" >}}
| Survivor|Meta Strategies|Design Theme|Skin Design|
|--------------|----------|-------|-------------------|
|Engineer|B.Fungus AFK | Bungus-Infested |"B.Fungus experiment gone wrong"|
|Captain| Diablo Nuke |Going Nuclear|"Soldier in the Old War built for Devastation"|
|Artificer|Endless Stun using Ice |Ice Witch|"Technomancer? Nah imma make magic real" + "a Certain Bringer for the age of stars"|

|Mul-T|Maximzing Speed on Minigun or Sniper |Machine Of War| "Arcade classic with a Tank" |
|Void Fiend|Glass Cannon |Engulfed in Void| “In his house at R’lyeh dead Cthulhu waits dreaming.” |
|Huntress|Crowbar stacking (adds more damage per Crowbar) |Half-Life| "Valve E-girl" |
|Acrid|Constant Trigger of Deathmark |Plague rat| "Moon Knight" + "Just A rat" + "one of the 4 horsemen of the apocalypse" |
|Rex|Heavy Life Drain| Plant And Machines |"Wall-E Plant Revolution"|
|Loader|The Only Melee Exclusive|Runebound Boxer|"Big Arms" + "Big Lady" + "Bunch of Crystals"|
|(WIP) Merc|Slicing Wind + Expose|Cyborg with a sword|-|

### How its made?

its made by utilizing a skinbuilder made by @kingenderbrine & @runefox on the Risk of Rain 2 Modding Discord. 

i did do some bit of modification to the code but nothing substantial.
