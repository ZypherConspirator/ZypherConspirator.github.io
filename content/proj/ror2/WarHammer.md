## whats this?

this series of character skins is based on the famous grimdark tabletop game, Warhammer 40K. made mainly due to comission work but it extended into me gaining an intrest in expanding it personally.

although this collection only variants of space marines. i am planning to expand it further.
this currently consist of;
    - Iron Fist SpaceMarine (Enforcer)
    - Iron Warriors SpaceMarine (Nemesis Enforcer)
    - Grey Knight SpaceMarine (Paladin)
    - Emperor's Champion SpaceMarine (Paladin)

### How its made?

starts with researching the designs of the speficied faction, usually in this kind of game setting it has some signature design elements to them.
since this game series is also known for its side hobby of model painting, people pay alot of attention to armor detail such as weapon and mask design no matter how minor.

after the research, off to blender to model. usually i just scroll on the web for some base 3D printable model, retopo that and use for the model. but this takes a lot of time to be invested thus sometimes its better to just start from scratch.

then to translating that the character's intended rig. this can take some time as its basically understanding how a rig works to know how to weight paint the mesh properly. different character has differing setup for rigs thus differing difficulties. 

after all that, we move to texturing, usually i put some vector paint first as it covers more ground, then bake that into proper UVed textures. then continue to Substance Painter to put in all the details and decals.

then to unity. its compiled by utilizing a skinbuilder made by @kingenderbrine & @runefox on the Risk of Rain 2 Modding Discord. it simply the process of making it workable but the coding isnt that hard to figure out if it were to come down to it.

then lastly trouble shooting, usually u have the process of figuring out the scaling of the model to look well in game.
