here is few of the skins that ive made so far in my Skin Modding Journey. the rest can be found on my thunderstore page [here](https://thunderstore.io/package/KrononConspirator/) and [here](https://thunderstore.io/package/Kronon_Conspirator/).

#### Mastery
implemented directly in the based mod, meant to celebrate an aspect of the character. designed to be an achievement for the player clearing the game in its hardest difficulty using these characters.

#### HGFacelift
noticed the player based would ignore modded playable characters that doesnt fit the aesthetics of RoR2, an initiative started by me to give them a facelift with a skin that suits their character while still keeping its original concept.
