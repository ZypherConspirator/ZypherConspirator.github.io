#### Mastery
implemented directly in the based mod, meant to celebrate an aspect of the character. designed to be an achievement for the player.

#### HGFacelift
noticed the player based would ignore modded playable characters that doesnt fit the aesthetics of RoR2, an initiative started by me to give them a facelift with a skin that suits their character while still keeping its original concept.
