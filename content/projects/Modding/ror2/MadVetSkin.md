This series of character skins represents my attempt to add a personal interpretation to the modding community.

In the early days of the community, skins were often used as a way for new modders to experiment, ranging from simple color variations of existing characters to highly personalized designs made primarily for individual use.

This project was among the earlier efforts to approach skins with a clear conceptual direction, encouraging further experimentation and more creative exploration within the community.

### Concept

This piece plays on community inside jokes about character-specific strategies, using them as the basis for the design.

For example, Engineer’s kit encourages passive play through deployable turrets. Combined with Risk of Rain 2’s item-stacking system and the Bustling Fungus—which heals while standing still—players discovered that Engineer could theoretically survive late-game encounters without input. This became known as the “Bungus Strat.”

The design visualizes that joke by turning the strategy into a literal form.

here are the rest of the ideas for the character;


| Survivor|Meta Strategies|Design Theme|Skin Design|
|--------------|----------|-------|-------------------|
|Engineer|B.Fungus AFK | Bungus-Infested |"B.Fungus experiment gone wrong"|
|Captain| Diablo Nuke |Going Nuclear|"Soldier in the Old War built for Devastation"|
|Artificer|Endless Stun using Ice |Ice Witch|"Technomancer? Nah imma make magic real" + "a Certain Bringer for the age of stars"|
|Commando|Constant Trigger of Chance based effects|Super soldier|"I Need a Weapon"|
|Railgunner|Knockback from Firing can Cause backwards Flight |Flight| "Air Force Jordans" + "USAF Pilot"|
|Mul-T|Maximzing Speed on Minigun or Sniper |Machine Of War| "Arcade classic with a Tank" |
|Void Fiend|Glass Cannon |Engulfed in Void| “In his house at R’lyeh dead Cthulhu waits dreaming.” |
|Huntress|Crowbar stacking (adds more damage per Crowbar) |Half-Life| "Valve E-girl" |
|Acrid|Constant Trigger of Deathmark |Plague rat| "Moon Knight" + "Just A rat" + "one of the 4 horsemen of the apocalypse" |
|Rex|Heavy Life Drain| Plant And Machines |"Wall-E Plant Revolution"|
|Loader|The Only Melee Exclusive|Runebound Boxer|"Big Arms" + "Big Lady" + "Bunch of Crystals"|
|(WIP) Merc|Slicing Wind + Expose|Cyborg with a sword|-|
|(?) Bandit|Purity + Desperado + Ratio-ed|Cleansed|-|

### How its made?

its made by utilizing a skinbuilder made by @kingenderbrine & @runefox on the Risk of Rain 2 Modding Discord. 

i did do some bit of modification to the code but nothing substantial.
